I only knew Flexbox from online courses but I have never used it on my own projects because I did not completely know the power of it. Now that I invested a weekend learning it, I do not see myself finishing a projects without using it. I have created a home page and training 1 and 2. All of them were made using Flexbox. You can scale down the screen to see how the content changes.
